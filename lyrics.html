        Whoa! Woah oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
        Hey, y'all (Hey, y'all)
        Welcome to the greatest storm
        I know (I know)
        You have waited much too long and I (And I)
        I will be your shining star
        I'm here (I'm here)
        Here to conquer near and far
        Like the sun (The sun) , I run (I run)
        Into the heat of day like a knight
        (Like a knight) , I'll fight (I'll fight)
        Until the fight is won
        In a rage (A rage) , I'll save (I'll save)
        Each and every, each and every
        Each and every one until this war is won
        And I live to rule by the sword
        Slashing through the every inch of the power
        The power in you as I sit, as I stand
        By the table, I command my kingdom
        I'm the knight of the wind
        Whoa! Whoa oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
        Hey, y'all (Hey, y'all)
        Welcome to the end it's near i know (I know)
        I will bring you pain and fear
        On the ground
        (The ground) to the sky (The sky)
        Faced with you and I
        In a flash (A flash) , I'm gone (I'm gone)
        Holding your crown high
        In a rage (A rage) , I'll save (I'll save)
        Each and every, each and every
        Each and every one until this war is won
        And I live to rule by the sword
        Slashing through the every inch of the power
        The power in you as I sit, as I stand
        By the table, I command my kingdom
        I'm the knight of the wind
        The knight of the wind
        I'm the knight of the wind
        Our castle is a massive force
        A stronghold of power
        My armour stays unbreakable
        In battle every hour!
        Woah! Woah oh! Woah, woah, woah!
        Like the sun (the sun) , I run (I run)
        Into the heat of day like a knight
        (like a knight) , I'll fight (I'll fight)
        Until the fight is won
        In a rage (A rage) , I'll save (I'll save)
        Each and every, each and every
        Each and every one until this war is won
        And I live to rule by the sword
        Slashing through the every inch of the power
        The power in you as I sit, I stand
        By the table, I command my kingdom
        I'm the knight of the wind
        The knight of the wind
